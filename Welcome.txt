Welcome to the Github practie for Ghosts.

Follow the steps in on the ghosts sites to get familiar with all the steps.
If any questions arise or you if you get stuck, just ask one of the mentors.

Once you get to the steps where you have to delete files, ONLY DELETE YOURS, so you won't delete somebody elses file.
AND DON'T FORGET TO SAVE YOUR FILES!!!!

This is a different biscuit than 'just coding'.

Good luck!


Cheers,
Milan and Joep
